## Time-Based Color Shifting

ColorShift Material Pro includes a unique feature that automatically adjusts your theme based on the time of day:

- **Morning Theme (6 AM - 6 PM)**: Brighter, more energetic colors to match your daytime workflow
- **Evening Theme (6 PM - 6 AM)**: Deeper, more relaxed colors that are easier on the eyes at night

To enable this feature:

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Type "ColorShift: Toggle Time-Based Color Shifting" and press Enter

You can customize the time ranges in your settings:

```json
"colorshift.morningStartHour": 6,  // Hour when morning theme begins (24-hour format)
"colorshift.eveningStartHour": 18  // Hour when evening theme begins (24-hour format)
```
